# tdns-update

This crate has been retired in favor of `tdns-cli`, where future
development and releases are happening. Do not install `tdns-update`,
as it no longer contains useful code, but instead contains only a
binary displaying a deprecation note. Visit [the tdns
repository](https://github.com/rotty/tdns-cli) for how to install and
use `tdns-cli`.
